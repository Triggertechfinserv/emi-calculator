    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 30, 2025</p>

    <p>
      These Apply Now – Terms & Conditions (“Apply Now Terms”) govern the submission of
      information by users through the “Apply Now”, “Get Expert Assistance”, or similar
      lead forms on the TechFinserv website.
    </p>

    <p>
      By submitting your details through the form, you acknowledge that you have read,
      understood, and agreed to these Apply Now Terms in addition to TechFinserv’s
      general <a href="/terms-and-conditions/">Terms & Conditions</a> and
      <a href="/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Nature of Service</h2>
    <p>
      TechFinserv provides guidance-only services intended to help users understand
      potential loan options based on the information shared. Submission of the form
      does not constitute a loan application, loan approval, or credit sanction.
    </p>

    <p>
      TechFinserv is not a bank or non-banking financial company (NBFC) and does not
      approve, disburse, or guarantee loans.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information Submitted</h2>
    <p>
      By submitting the form, you confirm that all information provided by you is true,
      accurate, and complete to the best of your knowledge. TechFinserv shall not be
      responsible for outcomes arising from incorrect or incomplete information.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Consent to Use Information</h2>
    <p>
      You expressly authorize TechFinserv to collect, store, process, and use the
      information submitted by you for the purpose of providing loan-related guidance,
      contacting you regarding suitable options, and improving service quality.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your information may be shared with third-party service providers or lending
      partners strictly for guidance or follow-up purposes and only in accordance with
      TechFinserv’s Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>4. DND / DNC Acknowledgement</h2>
    <p>
      By submitting the form, you acknowledge and agree that TechFinserv may contact you
      regarding loan-related guidance even if your mobile number is registered under
      the Do Not Disturb (DND) or Do Not Call (DNC) registry.
    </p>

    <h2>5. No Credit Bureau Impact</h2>
    <p>
      Submission of this form does not result in any credit bureau enquiry. A credit
      bureau check may occur only if you independently choose to proceed with a bank or
      NBFC at a later stage.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Document Collection and Further Processing</h2>

     <p>
     If you choose to proceed further with any loan option identified through TechFinserv’s
     guidance, you may be required to submit additional documents for verification and
     processing purposes.
    </p>
 
    <p>
     Such documents may include, but are not limited to, identity proof, address proof,
     income proof, bank statements, tax-related documents, and other loan-related records
     as required by the respective bank or non-banking financial company (NBFC).
    </p>

    <p>
     Submission of documents is completely voluntary and shall be initiated only after your
     explicit confirmation to proceed with a specific lender. TechFinserv does not collect
     or process such documents unless you choose to move forward beyond the guidance stage.
    </p>

    <p>
     All documents, where collected, are handled in accordance with applicable data
     protection standards and TechFinserv’s Privacy Policy, and are shared only with
     authorized lending partners for the purpose of loan evaluation.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Analytics and Session Recording</h2>
    <p>
      The Apply Now page may use analytics and session recording tools, including Google
      Analytics and Microsoft Clarity, to improve usability and detect technical issues.
      Such tools do not intentionally capture sensitive personal information.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      TechFinserv shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or
      consequential losses arising from submission of information, reliance on guidance
      provided, or interactions with third-party lenders.
    </p>
